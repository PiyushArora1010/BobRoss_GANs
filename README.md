# GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks.  Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.
# BobRoss
Robert Norman Ross (October 29, 1942 â€“ July 4, 1995) was an American painter, art instructor, and television host. He was the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe. Ross subsequently became widely known via his posthumous internet presence.
# Generator
A generator model is compiled which used Conv2DTranspose layers to upsample the input.
# Discriminator
A discriminator model is compiled which distinguishes between real and fake images.
